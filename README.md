# CodeIgniter Modules
This extension enables the creation of CodeIgniter Modules, making your application modular - Hierarchical Model View Controller (HMVC).

All modules are packed in their own directory, with their own individual files;
- Configs,
- Controllers,
- Database,
- Entities,
- Filters,
- Languages,
- Libraries,
- Models,
- Validation,
- Views, etc.
  
This allows code reusability and easy distribution of modules across other CodeIgniter applications.

## Installation
Download the file from github and place them into the `app/Commands` folders in the application directory.
